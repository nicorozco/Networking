    "# Introduction to SYN FLOOD attack\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is the SYN FLOOD Attack?\n",
    "\n",
    "The SYN FLOOD is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack that exploits a vulnerability in the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) implementation. It leverages the SYN (Sychronize)flag in TCP packets to overwhelm a target system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal TCP communication, a three-way handshake establishes a connection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **SYN (Synchronize):** The client sends a SYN packet to the server, initiating the connection.\n",
    "2.  **SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge):** The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the client's request and synchronizing its own sequence numbers.\n",
    "3.  **ACK (Acknowledge):** The client sends an ACK packet to the server, confirming the connection establishment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The attacker sends numerous TCP packets with the SYN flag set, but without actually creating a TCP Handshake exchange. The target's TCP stack then wastes resources trying to process and allocate resources to these SYN packets. This processing overhead can lead to performance degradation, resource exhaustion, and ultimately, denial of service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of the OPT-ACK attack:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Empty SYN :** The attack relies on sending SYN packets to initiate a TCP Connection but without actually finishing the establishment of a TCP connection .\n",
    "*   **Resource exhaustion:** The target's resources (CPU, memory) are consumed by allocating the appropriate resources needed for a TCP Connection. By Exhausting Resources, the target is no longer able to establish connections/communicate creating a denial of services"
